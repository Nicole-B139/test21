# Based on the statistical descriptions by group, we can infer that there are 
# slight differences between Group 1 and Group 2 in terms of the baseline text messages. 
# Group 1 has a mean baseline of 64, with a standard deviation of 10.67, 
# and a median of 64, indicating that the values are relatively centered 
# around the mean. 
# Group 2 has a slightly higher mean baseline of 65.6, with a standard deviation
# of 10.83, and a median of 65, suggesting a similar but slightly more spread 
#distribution compared to Group 1.
#The quantile analysis also indicates that both groups have similar ranges, 
# with Group 2 showing slightly higher values overall. This suggests that 
#while both groups are comparable, Group 2 tends to have slightly higher 
#baseline text message counts.

#65.22, which indicates a decline from baseline to sixmonths. The standard 
#deviation is 13.93 which shows that there is variability among the participants 
#six month scores. The min value is 9 showing that a least one person scored 
#very low.The max score is 79, which is lower than baseline of 89. This shows 
#that participants generally scored lower at the six month point versus baseline. 
#The first quartile is 53 meaning 25% of people scored below this value. The
#median is the midpoint which is 60.5. Lastly, the 3rd quartile is 63, the point 
#of where 75% of the scores fall.
