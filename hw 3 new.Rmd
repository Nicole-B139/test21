#from this given data set we can determine that their
#are 50 participants. The mean is 57.4. It is lower than the baseline mean at
#65.22, which indicates a decline from baseline to sixmonths. The standard 
#deviation is 13.93 which shows that there is variability among the participants 
#six month scores. The min value is 9 showing that a least one person scored 
#very low.The max score is 79, which is lower than baseline of 89. This shows 
#that participants generally scored lower at the six month point versus baseline. 
#The first quartile is 53 meaning 25% of people sored below this value. The
#median is the midpoint which is 60.5. Lastly, the 3rd quartile is 63, the point 
#of where 75% of the scores fall.
